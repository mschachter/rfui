--something about area of conentration in time and space - but I think this is just the max lag and max firing rate at max lag as that is what they had in the paper
--we actually had something about RF fitting in the estimate, but we didn't do it and it wasn't part of hist methods. 
--we also had corr/coef between spike train and predicted spike train, but that would only be if we did fitting
--decoder to get predicted continous variable from 1 or more neurons

-update gui to allow for change in order of spline as well as the number of
 knots. The CSFit and TuningCurve classes now takes a parameter for the number
 of knots. The default can be empty and that will put a spline between every
 point. Something like 3 gives good smoothing.

-For gui, we don't need the 'Spike Parameters' or the 'Sample Rate' stuff, as it isn't
 actually used. But, I think we can add a separate single unit visualization
 window so that one can view individual neurons and plot other variables along
 with it? Then adjust the time range and such? Using the SPDF that is created
 might also be useful for the decoder.

-For gui, in 'input information', should probably read 'average sampling rate'

-For gui, expose more params like plot resolution, number of subplots, filter
 width etc. take a look through classes and we should expose as many params as
 possible.

2) I don't think 'Dependent Variable' is updating when I click a
different one.  I tried clicking a couple and got identical heatmaps,
so I don't know which variable it's defaulting to. Two points on this:
        a) Can we put axes labels on the figures to reflect which variable
was selected?  This would make me more confident that it was updating.
 Can this be done across the board actually?  ie: can all selections
make it to the figure page (and output document when we get to that)?
        b) I'm still experiencing that issue where the 'Dependent Variable"
clickbox disappears after I click a variable - could this be r2009a?
I'm working on getting new Matlab here but haven't figured it out yet.

3) The heatmap parameters do not always update - when I change the
number of bins it sometimes still calculates 51 lags.  Sometimes it
works but I can't figure out why.  Do I have to do something to get
the new values to be recognized?

4) For almost all of the tuning curve fits (not the data points),
~10^1 is the max or min of the fit.  Often it looks like the fit is
going way out of the way to make this happen.  Can you check why this
is happening?  I'm attaching some examples of this. It also looks like
they are over-fitting, although Mariel said a 4th degree of freedom
spline worked best for her.  I tried to turn the degrees of freedom
down but it doesn't seem to do anything.  Maybe this variable is not
updating?

5) I see what you mean about the heatmaps probably being better off
all fit at once... Not sure why things looked different for Mariel.
I'll ask her.  But let's discuss implementing true receptive fields at
some point?

6) Lastly, are we ready to discuss an output excel sheet?
a. filename
b. cell
c. Average firing rate
d. Peak firing rate of tuning curve
e. Speed at peak firing rate of tuning curve
f. R2 for tuning curve fit
g. p-value for tuning curve fit
h. Peak firing rate of heatmap
i. Speed at peak firing rate of heat map
j. Time lag at peak firing rate of heat map
k. MIC of heat map
l. Or is there another way to quantify hot spots in heatmaps that's
more intuitive than MIC?
