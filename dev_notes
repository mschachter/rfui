column width of editor should be set to 120 characters

1)
make sure to 'clear all' ('clear' will not do it) when editing and testing classes to ensure proper reload of class methods and persistent data

2) 
-Class names should be capitalized. e.g. ExpData for a class that hold experimental data
-function and variable names should be in camelcase case. e.g. readTheData.m and myLocalVariable
-variable names should indicate the function of the variable. E.g. no 'for (ii =
 1:10)', but instead 'for (trialCounter = 1:10)'

3)
if necessary to clear ambiguity, use the following postfix to identify type of variable (I started using it everywhere but it quickly became a pain and hard to read):
D - double (E.g. spikeRateD, for a variable that represents spike rate as a double)
S - single
I - integer
C - character
L - logical
Ar - an array (E.g. 'DAr' for a double array);
Cr - cell array
Str - string
?? - class instance. For class variables use all the capitol letters. E.g. myLocalED for an instance of ExpData.

4)
Always define the atributes in a class, no defaults (E.g. SetAccess = public, even though this is the default)

5)
use 'its' prefix for properties that are private, and may have the same name as a public property.

6) 
use dependent variables, private versions, and get.functions for lazy evaluation
